同位语从句用于对前面出现的名词作进一步说明。

* 同位语从句经常紧跟在一些抽象名词之后出现，如news、idea、fact、promise、question、doubt、thought、hope、
message、suggestion、words、possibility、decision等。

    I’ve come from Mr wang with a message __that he won’t be able to see you this afternoon__．

    I had no idea __how many books I could borrow at a time__. 

* 有时同位语从句可以不紧跟在说明的名词后面，而被别的词隔开。

    The thought came to him __that maybe the enemy had fled the city__．

* 有时由于谓语较短，将同位语从句位于谓语之后。 

    The news came __that their team had won the championship__.
